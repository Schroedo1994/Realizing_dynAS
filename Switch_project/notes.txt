Input: A1, A2, switch point tau, target precision
tau and sigma are target values

E.g. sigma = 10e-8, tau = 10e-3

Run A1 until tau
-> we need to stop A1 once we found tau, so it needs to part of the while condition
-> pass on switch condition in algorithm call, e.g. if switch_cond = True or break condition

Run A2 from tau until target precision

Return x_opt, f_opt

Start an algorithm: a1(f)
Stop: only if while loop breaks or budget is empty

Make all parameters that need to be adapted part of the algorithm object
